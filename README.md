# transloadit-js-client

A work in progress - nothing to see here.

## Design Goals
 
 - Support for IE10+??
 - Lightweight / easy on dependencies
 - tus.io enabled
 - ES6
 - Robust (retries / resumes for *all the things*), avoid showing 'weird errors'
 - Small core, pluggable architecture for adding more file sources: (webcam / google drive / dropbox / etc)
 - Themable UI with a beautiful by default. UI is opt-out if people want to use just tus for instance
