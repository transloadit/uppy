Hi all! It’s New Year and Christmas time, and this year Santa is brining you Uppy `0.22` 🎁 This release packs a lot of neat stuff, but it also breaks things in quite a few places, so please read on. 

And, if you are celebrating, happy holidays from the Uppy Team! 🎄

## Preact and JSX

We’ve been happy using `yo-yo` and `hyperx` template strings in our views for quite a while, but decided to try something more stable. Preact has most of the great ideas of React, plus smaller file size as well as a few good ideas of its own.

All views have been refactored to utilize JSX. We actually liked hyperx a lot, but JSX has better tooling and syntax highlighting support. It also seems to be the standard in the React community.

See [#451 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/451) for details on why we switched and discussion around the process.

## Core and plugins refactor

- **⚠️ Breaking** We’ve renamed calls to `core` to `uppy` in plugins. So instead of `this.core.state` we now use `this.uppy.state`.
- **⚠️ Breaking** Events have been renamed to remove `core:` prefix. So `core:success` becomes just `success`, and so does `error`, `upload-started` and so on. Prefixed event names are used for plugin-specific event sometimes, like `dashboard:file-card`.
- **⚠️ Breaking** CSS class names have been altered to use `uppy-` namespace, so `.UppyDashboard-files` becomes `.uppy-Dashboard-files` and so on.
- **⚠️ Breaking** `getMetaFromForm` was removed in favor of new `Form` plugin (see below).
- **⚠️ Breaking** `MetaData` plugin was removed in favor of `metaFields` option in Dashboard, [see docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) for more details.
- Plugins now use `this.el` to refer to their UI element instead of `this.target`.
- `setPluginState` and `getPluginState` are now used in Providers.

## Refreshed Dashboard UI

![Uppy Dashboard UI with 3 files selected](/images/blog/0.22/uppy-dashboard-updated.jpg)

- File cards are simpler, we’ve removed the excess white backgrounds, improved the remove icon, reduced paddings, added slight shadows.
- Cicular upload button in the Dashboard has been moved to the StatusBar. It’s also not circular anymore, and there’s no cloud icon. Plain and simple.
- Redesigned “retry” and “add +1 file” buttons.
- Added `metaFields` option: an array of settings for UI field objects, which previousely lived in a separate `MetaData` plugin: `{ id: 'caption', name: 'Caption', placeholder: 'describe what the image is about' }`, [see docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) for more details.

See [#434 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/451) for more screenshots and details.

## Stores

As you know, internally Uppy uses its own simple state management system with `getState` and `setState` methods. In previous releases we’ve added support for Redux via a plugin called `Redux`, which mirrors all Uppy state to your Redux application’s state, and a plugin called `ReduxDevTools` that connects to Redux DevTools and enables all the cool time traveling stuff.

We are excited to tell you that this release makes state management even more flexible by bringing support for external stores! Here’s a quote from the docs:

> By default, Uppy stores its internal state in an object.
> If your app uses a state management library such as Redux, it can be useful to have Uppy store its state there instead—that way, you could write custom uploader UI components in the same way as the other components in the application.

Here’s how that works:

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux')
const ReduxStore = require('uppy/lib/store/ReduxStore')

const reducer = combineReducers({
  ...reducers,
  uppy: ReduxStore.reducer
})
const store = createStore(reducer)

const uppy = Uppy({
  store: ReduxStore({
    store: store // That's a lot of stores!
  })
})
...
```

Now Uppy will use your app’s Redux store instead of its own, so you have a “single source of truth” 🔮

## Form

`Form` is a new plugin that can be used in conjunction with any other. Here’s what it does: 

1. Acquires metadata from a `<form>` element of your choosing before the upload starts in Uppy.
2. Injects result array of succesful and failed files back into the form.

**⚠️ Breaking** With this plugin we’ve deprecated `getMetaFromForm` option that used to be in all acquire plugins like Dashboard and DragDrop. Now you can just use `Form`.

```js
uppy.use(Form, {
  target: '#my-form'
})
```

Read [more about the Form plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/form/) in docs.

## Encoding support in Golden Retriever

Our browser crash / page refresh restore plugin `Golden Retriever` (read [more about it](https://uppy.io/docs/golden-retriever/)) now supports correctly restoring [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) assemblies!

Also, we’ve fixed restoring from paused state. Now uploads will remain paused and not get out of sync.

## Type safe Server

Uppy-server now uses typescript to do some type checking in compile time. This helps spot some otherwise easy to miss compile time bugs. While the project's source is still written in javascript, the use of JsDoc specifications is leverages upon by typescript to detect data types with in the project.

This is a very positive step for uppy-server because a number of hidden bugs had already been identified and fixed thanks to
this, and it also makes uppy-server very well documented. :)

## And there’s more

- New `setFileState` method as a nice shorthand to update file-specific state.
- Added more extensions for mimetype detection.
- More plugin documentation 👍
- Misc bugs fixes and improvements in Webcam, Dashboard, Provider, so things should be more stable all around.
- Added an option to limit simultaneous uploads in XHRUpload.
- Fixed remote server error handler for uppy-server.
- Added [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to uppy-server to aid vulnerability detection.
