Spring is in the air and Uppy is feeling particularly full of life. In this post about Uppy 0.15, we have some exciting stories about `babel-plugin-yo-yoify` and progress event throttling. And we'd also like you to meet our new friend, Renée!

## Yo-yoify for NPM-installed Uppy

In [`0.14`](http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/0.14/), we added `yo-yoify` transform to give Uppy some extra speed and eliminate `Function.caller` issues. As it turned out, we [forgot](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/158) about our Babel-transpiled `lib` version of Uppy that gets published to NPM 🙀. We then spent some time creating a standalone version of `yo-yoify` that would be able to parse `yo-yo` template strings before Babel-transpilation, only to discover that there already is a [`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify) that not only does precisely that, but also frees us from jumping through a lot of unnecessary hoops. It did [have](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/9) [a few](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/pull/8) [issues](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/11) at first, but luckily our friend [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) was available to colaborate with us on this. Renée has also agreed to join Uppy for a while to help us with other pressing issues. So, silver linings — bugs can sometimes lead to new friends and wonderful beginnings. We are very excited about what this all means for Uppy in the months to come.

Uppy from NPM is now good to go and the issue has been completely resolved. You can update at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uppy. And yeah, if you use `yo-yo`, give [`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify) a try.

## Pause & Resume Remote Uploads

Just like with “local” uploads, Uppy now also has the possibility to pause and resume any uploads as long as they are handled by either `uppy-server` or `tus`, which happens when you select files from, for example, Google Drive or Dropbox. 🎉

## Progress Throttling

While working on pausing remote uploads with `uppy-server`, Ife discovered a strange bug: uppy-client would hang during the upload, after which the progress would immediately jump to 100%. After some solid Sherlock Holmesing, we found what was causing it: uploads were happening too fast. This was leading to progress events being sent very, very often (like 300 / second), which trashed the interface rendering loop. We have solved this by [adding throttling in tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/commit/9940f27b2361fd7e10ba58b09b60d82422183bbb) (thanks Marius!) and [uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/commit/936ad48e92631c45d123664900b9aabcf7a190fa) (thanks Ife!). I would also very much like to take this opportunity to thank myself for [fixing](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/1d5f4404546420442deabc94df84bd3ec0677eec) [it](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/db32c6f4fd85420532f27f04920dbaf6d126ea9b) in uppy-client too! :innocent:

To prevent “jumping” progress, numbers and text in StatusBar are now only updated once a second. Plus, we have also switched to [`prettier-bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-bytes), which adds some nice number rounding. Smooth as butter, baby!

TL;DR Uppy was simply too fast at uploading, so we had to shorten the leash a bit!

## Informer coming at you in full-color mode

Informer will now be able to change the way it looks depending on the `type` argument:

```js
// (`'informer'`, `text`, `type`, `duration`)
uppy.emit('informer', 'Connected!', 'success', 3000)
```

<img src="/images/blog/0.15/informer.png">

This supports the following `type`s: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, all with their own colors!

## Some other things

- Multipart now treats all 2xx responses as successful and returns xhr object in `core:upload-success` event callback.
- That progress circle that you can see on each file in Dashboard has been improved on the inside: precise `circleLength` and `stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset` calculation.
- Uppy-server returns uploaded file urls and sizes for remote uploads (from Google Drive & Dropbox).
- Provider plugins now have a loading screen, error screen and logout link. Breadcrumbs are also working again.

## Release Notes

Here is the full list of changes for version 0.15:

- build: update dependencies and eslint-plugin-standard, nodemon --> onchange, because simpler and better options (@arturi)
- build: fix `Function.caller` issue in `lib` which gets published to NPM package, add babel-plugin-yo-yoify (@arturi #158 #163)

- provider: fix breadcrumbs (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- server: refactor local/remote uploads in tus, allow for pause/resume with remote upload (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- server: throttle progress updates sent through websockets, sometimes it can be overwhelming when uploads are getting this fast (@ifedapoolarewaju)
- server: pass file size from Google Drive / Dropbox (@ifedapoolarewaju)

Enjoy!
