Last Christmas we gave you [Uppy 1.24](https://uppy.io/blog/2020/12/1.24/), this year we’ll take it away (since it’s outdated by now) and give you brand new Uppy 2.3 🎁!

After the [release](https://uppy.io/blog/2021/08/2.0/) of our latest major version, 2.0.0, we’ve been busy with many things. First of all the long awaited audio plugin to record and upload live audio directly. We also worked on adding a fast and efficient streaming interface to Companion and made Unsplash production-ready. Housekeeping was also part of the job. We made status bar improvements, moved from NPM to Yarn 3, did some refactoring, and updated dependencies.

Last but not least, we got the issue count down from around 110 since 2.0.0 to around 45 now.

## Audio plugin

Uppy now has a new `@uppy/audio` plugin for recording audio memos, sounds, Jingle Bells, Last Christmas, . Check it out [on the demo page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## `@uppy/unsplash` is now production ready

The Unsplash plugin has received an update, it provides attribution to the image authors, and adds some polish to make it look better. Being fully brand compliant with Unsplash means it’s now production-ready. You can demo the plugin on the [website](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard) or read the [docs](https://uppy.io/docs/unsplash/).

## New streaming interface for Companion

[Companion][companion] handles the server-to-server communication between your server and file storage providers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, and the like. This bypasses the client (so a 5 GB video isn’t eating into your users’ data plans) and is directly uploaded to the final destination. Companion is made to be effortlessly integrate-able with Uppy.

It works by downloading the requested file from a remote provider on the server to then start uploading it to the destination. This does the job but it’s not ideal.

We now build streaming support into Companion, which means the download and upload can happen simultaneously. This can result in **2x times faster uploads** because we no longer need to wait for files to finish downloading before starting the upload process. It’s especially useful for large files and removes the need for a lot of storage space on the server, as data will be buffered in-memory.

You can enable this by setting `streamingUpload` in the Companion [options](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Options).

**NOTE:** This is turned off by default. Do not turn it on yet if you’re using TUS for uploads, due to [this tus-js-client bug](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/275).

Interested in using Companion? You can use Transloadit hosted Companion on every [plan](https://transloadit.com/pricing/).

## Refactor locale scripts & generate types and docs

This is an internal change, but important nonetheless. Our locales now live in a separate `locale.js` file for every plugin instead of `this.defaultLocale` in the class. The docs and types are automatically updated when we add/remove new locale strings.

## Status bar error state improvements

Status bar plugin would get confused about upload errors in Uppy, and we’ve addressed that:

* Error state is shown if only _one_ failed file instead of _all_ failed files. Used to be stuck in the uploading state when a file failed.
* Added “x of x files uploaded” below “Upload failed” for extra context.
* Improved the error details button styling in the statusbar and the file info card.
* Status bar state is set to complete if the user manually removes the failed files.

PR [#3299](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3299).

## Yarn v3 instead of npm

We’ve switched the uppy repo to Yarn 3 to improve package install performance — with our complex dependency graph and over 30 packages in a monorepo, we are seeing a speed increase of over a few minutes!

We are using Corepack to make sure all Uppy contributors are using the same version of Yarn. If you are an Uppy contributor, please run the following commands to enable Corepack:

```sh
corepack -v || npm i -g corepack # install Corepack if not already installed
yarn -v || corepack enable # install Yarn through Corepack if not already installed
yarn || corepack yarn install # install npm dependencies using yarn
```
