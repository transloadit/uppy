In `0.30` we are introducing a new friend for Uppy — the Robodog.

<!--more-->

## Robodog

You already know [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com), the company behind Uppy and [Tus](https://tus.io). TL;DR Transloadit is the Swiss Army Knife for your files: importing, resizing, croping and watermarking images, making GIFs, transcoding videos, extracting thumbnails, generating audio waveforms, and so much more is a breeze with Transloadit.

Robodog is a new Uppy-based library that has been trained to work with Transloadit API. It includes:

1. A modal UI file picker (using the Dashboard plugin you know and love) with support for imports from third-party services. Used for profile avatars or images to embed in a blog post.
2. Integration with your existing HTML forms. Files will be uploaded to Transloadit, and the form will submit JSON information about the files and encoding results.
3. Programmatic uploads — just call `transloadit.upload(files, opts)` and get an array of results back.

> Because Robodog is based on Uppy, you can add any existing Uppy plugin to add more functionality.

You can install Robodog from NPM:

```shell
npm install --save @uppy/robodog
```

Or import it using an HTML script tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://transloadit.edgly.net/releases/uppy/v0.30.2/robodog.min.css">
<script src="https://transloadit.edgly.net/releases/uppy/v0.30.2/robodog.min.js"></script>
```

Here’s a demo:

<div class="wide">
  <p class="codepen" data-height="407" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="uppy" data-slug-hash="gEgPav" style="height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Robodog: resizing and optimizng your avatar">

</div>

## Dashboard UI improvements

As usual, we are iterating and impoving the Dashboard plugin. The accessibility has been improved, along with icons, bredcrumbs in remote providers and more.

Oh, and we’ve also improved how the progress is reported when no progress reporting is available:
