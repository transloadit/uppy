## Refreshed Dashboard and Providers

As always, we are trying to simplify and improve the UI of Uppy plugins. In this release, Dashboard’s design has been refreshed, check this out:

Meta editing screen:

Camera screen:

Import from URL (Link):

## Better StatusBar

StatusBar used to always show a lot of (unnecessary) progress details. This has been improved, by default it will now only show percentage:

<img src="/images/blog/0.24/statusbar-2.jpg">

But there’s an option `showProgressDetails: true` for the StatusBar and Dashboard (which passes it to StatusBar included in the Dashboard), that will show two lines of easy to understand progress:

<img src="/images/blog/0.24/statusbar-1.jpg">

```js
uppy.use(StatusBar, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })

// or

uppy.use(Dashboard, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })
```

We’ve also added a handy “cancel” button, which should cancel everything in progress regardless of the type of the upload.

## XHR Response Handling



## Powered by Uppy

Uppy is provided for the world for free by the [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) team. In return, we ask that you consider keeping a tiny tasteful Uppy logo at the bottom of the Dashboard, so that more people can discover and use Uppy.

This is entirely optional of course, just set `proudlyDisplayPoweredByUppy: false` option if you do not wish to display Uppy logo.

## Misc Good Stuff

- ⚠️ **breaking** `addFile()`, `onBeforeFileAdded()` and `onBeforeUpload()` are now synchronous, please see check out the update docs: [onBeforeFileAdded()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeFileAdded) and [onBeforeUpload()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeUpload).
- ⚠️ **breaking** most event now emit the whole file object instead of a fileId.
- ⚠️ **breaking** We’ve added `postcss-safe-important` to out style build step, so now 90% of rules got `!important` declaration added to them. This is done to prevent page styles (especially global like Bootstrap) from leaking into the Uppy widget. There are other solutions we are looking into, like iFrames and WebComponents, this is an experiment. Keep in mind that to override Uppy styles, you now have to also use `!important`.
- There’s now an option `showLinkToFileUploadResult: true` to disable linking to the upload result in Dashboard UI.
- We are now using the image time and date as a file name in Instagram.
- URL plugin checks for http(s) protocol, and add http by default if no protocol is present.
— It’s now possible to overrid `<DashboardModal />` React component’s target prop. 
- Provider views now have `showFilter` and `showBreadcrumbs` options, those are off for Instagram plugin, for example.
- Uppy Server to Client communication has been refactored into `Provider` and `Request` modules. Request can be used when a simple request needs to be made to Uppy Server, like in URL plugin, for example. Provider is used for more complex implementations shared between Google Drive and Instagram, for example.
- We’ve added Transloadit example to the website, [check it out](https://uppy.io/examples/transloadit/).

## Docs

- Uppy Server docs now point to a detailed write-up on how to run Uppy Server in Kubernetes (#706 / @kiloreux)
- Uppy Server custom provider example has been added, so now it’s easier create your own custom providers.
- More useful events, i18n strings, typos, fixes and improvements.
