Uppy 0.24.2 brings a refreshed UI in Dashboard and StatusBar, synchronous `addFile()`, cancel button, style protections, documentation on writing your own Uppy plugins, revamped XHR response handling and tons of fixes.

## Refreshed Dashboard and Providers

As always, we are trying to simplify and improve the UI of Uppy plugins. In this release, Dashboard’s design has been refreshed, check this out:

Meta editing screen:

Camera screen:

And more, check out the [Dashboard example page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## Better StatusBar

StatusBar used to always show a lot of (unnecessary) progress details. This has been improved, by default it will now only show percentage:

<img src="/images/blog/0.24/statusbar-2.jpg">

But there’s an option `showProgressDetails: true` for the StatusBar and Dashboard (which passes it to StatusBar included in the Dashboard), that will show two lines of easy to understand progress:

<img src="/images/blog/0.24/statusbar-1.jpg">

```js
uppy.use(StatusBar, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })

// or

uppy.use(Dashboard, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })
```

We’ve also added a handy “cancel” button, which should cancel everything in progress regardless of the type of the upload.

## XHR Response Handling

When the upload completes (regardless of whether it succeeded), a `response` key gets added to the file. `file.response` contains a `status` and `data` properties. `data` is the result of the `getResponseData()` option. The `getResponseData()` function's signature is now:

```js
getResponseData (responseText, response) { }
```

Example: this is what the default JSON parsing implementation (which you can override looks like in `XHRUpload` plugin:

```js
getResponseData (responseText, response) {
  let parsedResponse = {}
  try {
    parsedResponse = JSON.parse(responseText)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }

  return parsedResponse
}
```

The `responseText` is the XHR endpoint response as a string. For uploads from the user's device, `response` is the [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) object.

When uploading files from remote providers such as Dropbox or Instagram, Uppy Server sends upload response data to the client. This is made available in the `getResponseData()` option as well. The `response` object from Uppy Server contains some properties named after their [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) counterparts:

 - `response.responseText` - the XHR endpoint response as a string;
 - `response.status` - the HTTP status code;
 - `response.statusText` - the HTTP status text;
 - `response.headers` - an object mapping lowercase header names to their values.

## Powered by Uppy

Uppy is provided for the world for free by the [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) team. In return, we ask that you consider keeping a tiny tasteful Uppy logo at the bottom of the Dashboard, so that more people can discover and use Uppy.

This is entirely optional of course, just set `proudlyDisplayPoweredByUppy: false` option if you do not wish to display Uppy logo.

## Other Fixes & Improvements

- ⚠️ **breaking** `addFile()`, `onBeforeFileAdded()` and `onBeforeUpload()` are now synchronous and have to return nothing or file objects to proceed, or false to abort; please check out the update docs for details: [onBeforeFileAdded()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeFileAdded) and [onBeforeUpload()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeUpload).
- ⚠️ **breaking** Most event now emit the whole `file` object instead of a `fileId`. So you can access `file.name` right away, for example, without having to fish the file using its id first, like before.
- ⚠️ **breaking** We’ve added `postcss-safe-important` to out style build step, so now 90% of rules got `!important` declaration added to them. This is done to prevent page styles (especially global like Bootstrap) from leaking into the Uppy widget. There are other solutions we are looking into, like iFrames and WebComponents, this is an experiment. Keep in mind that to override Uppy styles, you now have to also use `!important`.
- dashboard: ⚠️ **breaking** `maxWidth`, `maxHeight` options have been converted to `width` and `height`, because this makes more sense, `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` are actually `100%`.
- There is now an option `showLinkToFileUploadResult: true` to disable linking to the upload result in Dashboard UI.
- We are now using the image time and date as a file name in Instagram, instead of a generic file id.
- URL plugin now checks for http(s) protocol, and add http by default if no protocol is present.
- It’s now possible to override `<DashboardModal />` React component’s target prop.
- Provider views now have `showFilter` and `showBreadcrumbs` options, those are off for Instagram plugin, for example.
- Uppy Server to Client communication has been refactored into `Provider` and `Request` modules. Request can be used when a simple request needs to be made to Uppy Server, like in URL plugin, for example. Provider is used for more complex implementations shared between Google Drive and Instagram, for example.
- We’ve added Transloadit example to the website, [check it out](https://uppy.io/examples/transloadit/).

## Docs

- Uppy Server docs now point to a detailed write-up on how to run Uppy Server in Kubernetes (#706 / @kiloreux)
- Uppy Server custom provider example has been added, so now it’s easier create your own custom providers.
- More useful events, i18n strings, typos, fixes and improvements.

## Server News

On the Server side we tackled a number of security issues.

- Fixed security vulnerability in transient dependency [#70](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/issues/70)
- Auto-generate tmp download file name to avoid Path traversal
- Namespace redis key storage/lookup to avoid collisions
- Validate callback redirect url after completing OAuth
- Reduce the permission level required by google drive

Other non security improvements are:

- Auto-generate Server secret if none is provided on startup
- We implemented a more standard logger for Uppy Server
- Added an example project to run Uppy Server on Serverless, [see](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/tree/master/examples/serverless).
