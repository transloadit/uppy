## Done

We haven't even hit April 1 yet and the 'Done' section of the project dashboard is already getting plenty of love! Today, [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) finished designing a specialized header for visitors of Uppy.io and [Tus.io](https://tus.io) to inform them about the discount on [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) services they can receive :wink:

[Adbel](https://github.com/Kiloreux) started a dialogue with the team regarding [Docker secrets](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/138), seeing as [an issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1295) about this was reported. He decided that the best course of action was to follow the Kubernetes [best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#best-practices) and add a `Secret` resource to contain the environment variables.

## In Progress

One of the more exciting updates of this day was also contributed by Alex, with his impressive pre-alpha sketch of a new homepage for Uppy. Despite only being a work in progress, the entire team has been overjoyed with how it's turning out! Take a look for yourself (click to see the full page):

[Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) has been focused on [fixing hanging Instagram files uploaded through Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1274/files) and our content team's own [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo) added examples for [handling uploads in Node.js, and in Python (using the Flask microframework)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389).

And that's Day 4 complete! Catch up with us [tomorrow](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-05/), as we take this thing into our first weekend of the 30 Days to Liftoff! And of course, if you want to keep yourself constantly updated, feel free to subscribe to our [RSS feed](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) :smile:
