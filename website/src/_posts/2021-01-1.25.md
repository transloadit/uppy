Uppy 1.25 adds support for right-to-left scripts, Ukrainian translation and various improvements for Companion.

Just see how cool this looks, and read further for a video demo and some behind the scenes implementation sorcery:

## Right-to-left scripts

Renée have improved support for right-to-left scripts (such as Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew). This means that Uppy UI can now be mirrored, like how you might see on sites like [Wikipedia](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9\_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9).

HTML `dir` attribute can be used to set the direction — any parent element of the Dashboard may have it. It’s good practice for sites to add a dir attribute on `<html>` element, but for backwards compatibility the Dashboard will default to left-to-right rendering.

The text direction can also be set in code using the new `direction` option for the Dashboard plugin. This is useful for the modal dashboard, which would typically be mounted in the `<body>` element, so there is no other parent element that you could set the `dir` attribute on (aside from `<body>` and `<html>`, which sites *should* do, but may not).

> Head over to the [#2705 PR description and code](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2705), if you are interested in how this is implemented, using new CSS properties like `inline-start` and `inline-end` with `postcss-logical` and `postcss-dir-pseudo-class` for the fallback.

## Locales

[@DenysNosov](https://github.com/elkebab) contributed a Ukrainian translation and fixes for Russian grammar!

## Integration Guide

Andrew, who’s been on fire recently adding Vue and Svelte integrations for Uppy, has taken the time to share his experience and has written an “[Adding a new integration](/docs/contributing.html#Adding-a-new-integration)” guide, in case you’d like to help befriend Uppy with your favorite framework or library.

## Companion

*   Added support for setting 3rd party credentials in runtime
*   Metadata is now passed to S3
*   Support for `opts.companionCookiesRule` rule
