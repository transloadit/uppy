And another week bites the dust! With the weekend right around the corner, we're busy getting as much as possible done before heading off for some well-deserved rest & relaxation. Here is what we've been up to!

## New

*   [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is test driving Uppy('s accessibility) in many different browsers and already uncovered [many issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) in some naughty browsers. Hope we'll manage to fix all of them before April 25!

## In Progress

*   [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) is working on preparing the changelog for Uppy v. 0.30.4 and releasing it as soon as possible. More news about the 0.30.4 release can be found in the *Done* section.

*   Our React Native team (that's [Artur](https://github.com/arturi), [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju), and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz)) have been pairing again and determined there are only a few things left to do:

    *   Add customFingerPrint & hashCode into Ife's tus-js-client branch, add tests, and get it into shape for [Marius](https://github.com/acconut) to review
    *   UI tweaks (close button for Import, reporting errors)
    *   File preview icon for non-image files

*   They also discussed a few non-React Native things:

    *   Large file support
    *   Companion XHR Uploads should report download progress towards client-side-reported upload progress
    *   When you upload to api2.transloadit.com with XHR, it seems the API does not block and responds with 200 before the upload is really done (MAYBE :o). This results in a bad Uppy state without a progress bar.

## Done

*   We released a new version of Uppy. While it isn’t 1.0 just quite yet, this is another step in the right direction. Uppy `0.30.4` features fixes for `allowSyntheticImports`, Typescript typings, issues when using Companion Client for remote AWS-S3 uploads, and using websockets and console.dir in React Native.

*   Artur and [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) reviewed and merged a [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1360) that allows a user to customize the status of an upload in Uppy. Thanks to [Mactavish](https://github.com/Mactaivsh) for contributing!

*   [Abdel](https://github.com/kiloreux) [fixed the Serverless example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1408) for running Companion on AWS Lambda.

*   [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) finished up his work on the [new documentation menu structure](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405) that we talked about [yesterday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-10/). 

That’s it. All the updates I have for you today. Have a great [weekend](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-12/) everyone! And if you don’t want to miss a post, keep tabs on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) feed.
