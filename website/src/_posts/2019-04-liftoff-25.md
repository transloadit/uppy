Why have a Good Friday when you can have a Great Friday instead!? Today is the beginning of an extra-long weekend, which most of the Uppy crew will spend by staying away from computers and catching up on some naptime:

Even though there's still quite a bit to do before the **Uppy 1.0 launch next week**, we're taking these few days for ourselves to fully recharge the batteries before breaking into our final sprint on Tuesday. :running: Be sure to check in with us during the weekend, though, for some fun little updates in our 30 Days to Liftoff!

Have a Great Friday everyone!
