Uppy `1.10.1` adds long-awaited support for [Facebook](/docs/facebook/) and [OneDrive](/docs/onedrive/) 🎉

![Screenshot showing Uppy file uploader with Facebook and OneDrive options](/images/blog/1.10/uppy-facebook-onedrive.png)

```js
const uppy = Uppy()
uppy.use(Dashboard)
uppy.use(Facebook, { target: Dashboard, companionUrl: 'https://companion.uppy.io/' })
uppy.use(OneDrive, { target: Dashboard, companionUrl: 'https://companion.uppy.io/' })
```

Try the live demos on [Transloadit.com](https://transloadit.com): import your files from Facebook or OneDrive, and then:

*   [Apply a watermark to an image](https://transloadit.com/demos/image-manipulation/text-watermarking/)
*   [Convert an image to WebP](https://transloadit.com/demos/image-manipulation/convert-to-webp/)
*   [Encode a video, extract 8 thumbnails and store everything in an S3 bucket](https://transloadit.com/demos/file-exporting/store-encoding-and-thumbnails-on-s3/)
*   [Encode video for iPhone](https://transloadit.com/demos/video-encoding/encode-for-apple-iphone-11-pro-max/)
*   [Create a single Zip file containing all uploaded files](https://transloadit.com/demos/file-compressing/create-one-zip-file-containing-all-uploaded-files/)

(Uppy demos are below the description and steps, under “Live Demo. See for yourself” ;-)

<!--more-->

As with Dropbox and Instagram, using the Facebook and OneDrive integrations requires the client Plugins (see [here for Facebook](/docs/facebook/) and see [here for OneDrive](/docs/onedrive/)), and also your [Companion](/docs/companion/#Options) integration.

This is an exciting release for us, and we can't wait to get some feedback (GitHub issues and PRs) on this! :)
