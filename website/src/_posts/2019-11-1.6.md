This release adds a long-awaited `uppy.setOptions()` API, allowing you to update options of Uppy and its plugins on the fly. It also includes locales for the Icelandic and Thai languages!

## uppy.setOptions()

`.setOptions()` for Uppy and its plugins supports most options that can be easily changed on the fly: `restrictions`, `locale`, Dashboard’s `note` and `metaFields`, `disableThumbnailGenerator`, `showProgressDetails`, etc.

⚠️ Note that some options like `target`, `limit` and `id` cannot be changed on the fly, as internal statefull things depend on them.

Here’s how the magic works:

```js
const uppy = Uppy({
  restrictions: {
    maxNumberOfFiles: 3,
  },
})
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  note: 'You can upload up to 3 files',
})
```

Now, based on some condition in our app, we want to allow more files:

```js
// Updating Uppy options
uppy.setOptions({
  restrictions: {
    maxNumberOfFiles: 5,
  },
})
// Updating Dashboard options
uppy.getPlugin('Dashboard').setOptions({ note: 'You can upload up to 5 files' })
```

Say, later on, the user changed their locale and we would like to reflect that in Uppy:

```js
const fi_FI = require('@uppy/locales/lib/fi_FI')

uppy.setOptions({
  locale: fi_FI,
})
```

Now, Uppy will bark in Finnish! Hau, hau, hau!

Please see [`uppy.setOptions()` docs](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#uppy-setOptions-opts) for details.
