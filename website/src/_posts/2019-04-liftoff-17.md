It's day 17 already of our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge and the **launch of Uppy 1.0 on April 25** is coming closer by the day. The Uppy team is dealing with the big tasks now, so the updates might seem a little scant!

## Done

*   [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) updated the [React Native](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) UI example. This is what the new UI looks like:

*   [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) updated the focus styles on the Uppy Dashboard, making it look quite a bit sleeker than it did before. Here's a before and after view of the Dashboard focus styles:

## In Progress

*   Artur is reviewing PRs, reporting errors and testing Uppy in response to the team’s feedback.

*   Alex continues [improving Uppy's UI](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/master...nqst:design-facelift) and has recently been refactoring CSS code, while [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) keeps charging at the [many accessibility issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) that are still open.

*   Evgenia is also working on the new drag/drop implementation, which will include a new *Drop Here* placeholder and not experience any flickering. And as if that weren't enough, she is having a go at `drop folder` support for cross-browser compatibility as well, so that it won’t be relying on DOM manipulation in our Preact components.

*   [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) is updating this [PR](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73), which deals with supporting resumability for Node.js environments.

That's all from us today. As I mentioned, we are now focusing on the big tasks and as a result, our daily list of updates might sometimes be a little shorter than usual. Remember to keep tabs on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) for more Uppy updates. [Day 18](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-18/) is coming up next!
