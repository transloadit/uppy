Shh, it's Sunday, Uppy is sleeping in today :sleeping: We'll be taking the day off as well, as we gear up to go full throttle again in the morning. There's still a lot to do before the **Uppy 1.0 launch on April 25**. In the meantime, why don't you join us in letting sleeping dogs lie.

We hope this drowsy puppy inspires you to have a great and relaxing remainder of your weekend. We'll have a lot more to share with you tomorrow, so see you on [Day 14](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-14/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
