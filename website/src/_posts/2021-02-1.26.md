Uppy 1.26 brings a new `disabled` option for the Dashboad, ability to set headers per file with XHR Upload, and fixes for the Transloadit plugin.

## Dashboard “Disabled”

You can now specify a `disabled` option for the Dashboard, in order to make it non-interactive and grayed out. Users won’t be able to click on buttons or drop files.

This is useful when you need to confitionally enable/disable file uploading or manipulation, based on a condition in your app.

This option can be set on init:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  disabled: true,
})
```

and via API:

```js
const dashboard = uppy.getPlugin('Dashboard')
dashboard.setOptions({ disabled: true })

userNameInput.addEventListener('change', () => {
  dashboard.setOptions({ disabled: false })
})
```

[See the docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#disabled-false).

## XHR Upload Per File headers

`@uppy/xhr-upload` now accept a `headers: (file) => {}` function, so you can do:

```js
uppy.use(XHRUpload, {
  headers: file => ({
    'authorization': `bearer ${global.userToken}`,
    'header-name': file.meta.someMetaValue,
  }),
})
```

to determine file-specific headers.

The function syntax for `headers` is only available if the `bundle` option is `false` (the default). `bundle` uploads share only one set of headers.

## Build System Improvements

*   build: set legacy-peer-deps for npm 7. We have some peerDependency mismatches in our install tree. In npm 6 this was OK (maybe reason for a warning) but in npm 7 they hard fail the install
*   build: added npm version check (33e656cad32b865f960dbd88abf4d3839c8377f0 / @goto-bus-stop)

## Transloadit Plugin

*   Fixed a case where the plugin used stale file data.
*   Fixed polling fallback bugs.
*   Url concatenation is now more robust.

## Misc

*   @uppy/companion: Docker tag release (#2771 / @kiloreux)
*   @uppy/companion: Companion should respect previously set value for Accesss-Control-Allow-Methods (#2726 / @tim-kos, @mifi, @so-steve)
*   @uppy/transloadit: fix polling fallback bugs (#2759 / @goto-bus-stop)
*   @uppy/utils: added mp4 file type support — Safari 14.0 on Mac records audio using audio/mp4 MIME type which isn't currently recognised by Uppy (#2753 / @dominiceden)

See [changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1260) for details.
