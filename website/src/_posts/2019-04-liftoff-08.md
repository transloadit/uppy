Welcome to Day 8 of our ongoing thirty-day blog post challenge toward the **Uppy 1.0 release on April 25**! Yesterday was the 1st of April, but we had no time for fooling around! The entire team was present for our weekly call, which was again fully dedicated to discussing Uppy progress.

During the call, a lot of cards were moved from the `To Do` lane into the `in progress` lane — and some are even already `done`. We also added a few `new` tasks related to language packs for Uppy, where we'll be asking our own team members to update a locale of their own language. We hope the rest of them will be picked up by the community!

This is what our board currently looks like:

Let's take a look at the updates we can share with you today.

## Done
- [Artur](https://transloadit.com/about/#artur) merged this [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1393) which removed the use of `window.location` from Companion's client, courtesy of [Ife](https://transloadit.com/about/#ife).
- [Alex](https://transloadit.com/about/#alex) improved the design of the drag-to-upload stage. <br />

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) made sure that file previews now form an even spread across the width of the dashboard.

## In Progress

- We are currently investigating an issue with `tus-js-client`, which affects uploads where the file size is larger than 500MB as reported in this [issue](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146).

- We are also doing more research on `tus-js-client` fingerprints. Since these are identical for each file on React Native, the team is figuring out how to properly identify files on that platform, because [the standard file properties that tus-js-client relies on](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/master/lib/fingerprint.js#L10) are not available.

- We have our first WIP screenshot for the React Native implementation:

- Artur is trying to execute a 600MB upload and then see if it crashes, as reported in a `tus-js-client` issue. After that, he will set chunkSize, test the upload again, and report back his findings so we can evaluate our next steps.

- [Abdel](https://transloadit.com/about/#abdel) is busy fixing the serverless examples where WebSockets are terminated when Uppy is deployed to Lambda

- Evgenia is working on applying for [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source?ref=pricing)'s open-source program, so we can hopefully test Uppy even more and make sure that 1.0 is without any issues.

- Ife is writing tests for the implementation of the `tus-js-client` URL storage.

That's all the updates I have for you today. See you tomorrow for [Day 9](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-09/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
