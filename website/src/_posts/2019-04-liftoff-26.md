'Twas the night before Easter, when all through the house. Not a creature was stirring, not even a... pup?

That's right! It's another day of leisurly fun and relaxation for the Uppy team. We're kind of in the calm before the storm right now, though. First, we'll have a few days of Easter ahead — filled to the brim with chocholate, eggs and bunnies — and then it's off to the races for real.

When we return on Tuesday, we'll only have two working days left before the **Uppy 1.0 launch on April 25** and a few big tasks still remain uncompleted. So, while we wait for crunch time to begin, enjoy some nice holiday updates from us over the coming days!
