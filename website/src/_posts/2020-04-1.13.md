Releases 1.11 through 1.13 introduced a bunch of major new features and bugfixes. Let's go through the main ones!

## Dark mode

A little while ago we’ve [announced work in progress](https://mobile.twitter.com/uppy_io/status/1221070643543838721) on Dark Mode for the Dashboard. We're happy to tell you it’s live now! You can try it out on [the Dashboard example page](/examples/dashboard/).

</video>

There are three options available:

*   `light` — the default
*   `dark`
*   `auto` — will respect the user’s system settings and switch automatically

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  theme: 'dark',
})
```

## Custom meta fields

This is big one! Thanks to @galli-leo, you can now add custom fields to the Dashboard meta editor, such as `<input type="tel">`, `<select>` or `<input type="checkbox">`, like this:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
  trigger: '#pick-files',
  metaFields: [
    { id: 'caption', name: 'Caption', placeholder: 'describe what the image is about' },
    {
      id: 'public',
      name: 'Public',
      render: ({ value, onChange }, h) => {
        return h('input', {
          type: 'checkbox',
          onChange: (ev) => onChange(ev.target.checked ? 'on' : 'off'),
          defaultChecked: value === 'on',
        })
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

See [the docs](/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) and [PR #2147](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.

## Google Docs support in Companion

In the past, Uppy could already import files from Google Drive using Companion. However, files from Google Docs are not *really* files, and could not be imported. That was confusing for users: some of their files simply didn't appear!

Companion now automagically converts GSuite documents, such as docs, spreadsheets and presentations, to `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.ppt` files that can be opened in various applications. The current list of conversions is hardcoded to:

```json
{
  "application/vnd.google-apps.document": ".docx",
  "application/vnd.google-apps.drawing": ".png",
  "application/vnd.google-apps.script": ".json",
  "application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet": ".xlsx",
  "application/vnd.google-apps.presentation": ".ppt"
}
```

This may be configurable in a future release.

Note that only documents under 10MB are converted. This is a limitation set by the Google Drive API.

## AWS S3

The Aws S3 plugin now handles uploads internally, instead of deferring to XHR Upload. This change fixes many bugs with Aws S3. See [PR #2060](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.

## Locales

Polish, Croatian and Romanian language packs have been added by @alfatv, @dkisic and @akizor :tada:

## Exifr in Thumbnail Generator

[@MikeKovarik](https://github.com/MikeKovarik) created an awesome library called [Exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr), useful for extracting EXIF image data. He was kind enough to submit a PR that replaces Uppy’s internal fork of `exif-js` with `exifr`. Our thumbnail generation is now faster and more robust! See [PR 2140](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2140) for details.
