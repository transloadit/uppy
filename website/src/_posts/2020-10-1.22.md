Uppy 1.22 (the spooky Halloween edition) adds a new Unsplash provider, Webcam camera selector dropdown and a `maxTotalFileSize` restriction.

## Webcam Camera Source

If your device has multiple cameras, you can now choose which one you want to use (if you allow the [showVideoSourceDropdown](https://uppy.io/docs/webcam/#showVideoSourceDropdown-false) option).

## maxTotalFileSize

New `maxTotalFileSize` restriction makes sure the total size of all the files selected isn’t over a certain threshold:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
  restrictions: {
    maxTotalFileSize: 104857600,
  },
})
```

## Unsplash

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a popular website dedicated to sharing free stock photography. With a new Uppy plugin you can search for “trains”, “New York” or “Harry Potter” images and upload them where needed:

The plugin launches in beta, but you can already try it out by installing `@uppy/unsplash` and upgrading `@uppy/companion` to the latest version (2.1.0).
