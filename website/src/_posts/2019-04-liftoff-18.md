Hi! You're reading our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge about the **launch of Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. Here's what we've been up to since yesterday's progress update.

*   [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) addressed all of [Marius'](https://github.com/Acconut) feedback towards [having React-Native-compatible fingerprinting](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73) in tus-js-client.

*   [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) had a call where they discussed Alex’s design improvements, and Alex's [Design Facelift PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1442) is now ready to be reviewed and merged :tada:

*   Artur iterated on [Samuel's](https://github.com/samuelayo) [XHR backend examples](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389).

*   Ife, Artur, Alex and Marius are chasing down an issue where appending form fields is [causing 423 responses from tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd/issues/259). Marius already pushed out a number of fixes as a result and released a new version of tus-js-client (1.7.1).

*   Artur and [Kevin](https://github.com/tim-kos) paired up to create a new structure for [Locale Packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443). The `en_US` locale is now generated from whatever strings where used in Uppy's plugins, so other languages can use it as a reference. There will also be reporting on unused strings.

*   [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues to charge at fixing Drag & Drop issues, and [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) is working on making the Robodog Dashboard work inline (as well as a popup).

Hope you'll have a great weekend and see you on [Monday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-21/) for another real update on the 1.0 launch preparations! We'll of course also have a few more light-hearted posts in the meantime for you, so be sure to check those out as well :slightly_smiling_face: Keep tabs on [@uppy_io](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) for more Uppy updates!
