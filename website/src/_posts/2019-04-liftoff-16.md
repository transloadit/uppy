Two weeks left in our '30 Days to Liftoff'! We're starting to home in on **Uppy 1.0's release on April 25**. Being in the middle of the week gives us a great opportunity to see how hard the team is working. Let's take a look at the new features, bug fixes and milestones that have been completed! :dog:

Reminder: you can keep up with our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see everything else we intend to complete for the official Uppy 1.0 release.

## Done

*   [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues working on the [peculiar flickering issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1400#issuecomment-481039845) in our Dashboard example. While it was tricky at first, a (temporary) hotfix has now been applied. A more in-depth update is coming after 1.0 :smile:

*   The [first contribution](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1436) in our sprint coming from outside the Uppy team was added by [Zeqiu](https://github.com/allenfantasy). It concerns events being fired when an uploaded file fails a restriction check. With this feature, it will be a lot easier to know which file has been restricted from upload and why.

*   And the [second outside contribution](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1429) comes from [Andreas](https://github.com/ap--), who fixed an issue involving the use of both tus and the limit parameter to set a maximum number of parallel uploads.

Big shout out to both!

## In Progress

*   The React Native team has their pairing session at 14:00 today, during which they will work on [React Native support](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) for Uppy, [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client) and [Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/packages/@uppy/companion).
    *   [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) will be working on tweaking the React Native UI and dealing with file preview icons for non-image files. He has also been working on refactoring some of the code to make things much tidier.
    *   [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) will be integrating fingerprinting and hash code support [into tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73).
    *   If the team has the time, they will also look into large file support, upload and download reporting for Companion XHR uploads, and an issue concerning XHR uploads with the [Transloadit API](https://transloadit.com/docs/api/).

*   [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) continues [improving Uppy's UI](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/master...nqst:design-facelift) and has recently been refactoring CSS code, while Evgenia keeps charging at the [many accessibility issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) that are still open.

In addition to getting Uppy 1.0 out of the dog house, I mentioned that the team is already talking about features and fixes to tackle after 1.0. If you look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), you'll notice some 1.1 todos in there. There's always room for improvement, so now you have something to look forward to after Uppy 1.0 hits the web! :wink:

That's all from me today. Stay in the loop with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) for more Uppy updates. [Day 17](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-17/)  is coming up next!
