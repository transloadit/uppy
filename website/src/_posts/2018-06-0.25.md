Uppy 0.25 comes with a couple of new features, like drag-and-dropping urls and images with Url plugin, Dashboard modal animation and interactive components in i18n strings, as well as a ton of under the hood fixes and improvements.

## Select In Providers

Selecting files doesn’t add files to Uppy immediately anymore. Instead a “Select” button appears (with a counter), and pressing that adds all the files with checked checkboxes and closes the Instagram or Google Drive overlay. Cancel discards the selection and also closes the overlay.

This addresses an undesirable case where `autoProceed: true` would begin uploading files the moment you ticked a checkbox, and you couldn’t see what was going on because the provider overlay was still open.

## Drag & Drop or Paste Links And Images with Url Plugin

If you have the [Url plugin](/docs/url/) enabled, it will now accept pasted or drag-dropped direct file links and images — those will get added to Uppy as if you open the Url plugin panel and entered the Url there:

## i18n Strings with Interactive Components

⚠️ **breaking**

We’ve changed how i18n strings work with interactive components. We now use placeholder for those interactive buttons, so it works nicely in languages that have different word order than English. Example:

```js
dropPasteImport: 'Drop files here, paste, import from one of the locations above or %{browse}'
browse: 'browse'
```

`%{browse}` will be replaced with a button/link.

We can’t do this in all situations yet, because some parts of some strings need to be wrapped in Preact elements, which the Translator can’t handle.

Here’s a list of strings that were changed in this release, please update those in your locales:

- core: `failedToUpload` needs to contain `%{file}`, substituted by the name of the file that failed
- dashboard: `dropPaste` and `dropPasteImport` need to contain `%{browse}`, substituted by the "browse" text button
- dashboard: `editing` needs to contain `%{file}`, substituted by the name of the file being edited
- dashboard: `fileSource` and `importFrom` need to contain `%{name}`, substituted by the name of the provider
- dragdrop: `dropHereOr` needs to contain `%{browse}`, substituted by the "browse" text button

See full list of locale strings for each plugin you are using on [Uppy Docs](/docs/).

## React Documentation

React docs have been improved: we now have a [separate page](/docs/react/) for each Uppy React wrapper component that we offer. 

Other improvements in docs:

- The `id` option is now listed on each plugin's documentation page.
- The `replaceTargetContent` option is listed on UI plugin documentation pages.
- The `locale` option is described on each plugin documentation page, and includes a short description for each string. The default value is removed from the snippet at the top of the ## Options section to save some space (since it's a very large object sometimes).

## Typescript Definitions

[@taoqf](https://github.com/taoqf) went ahead and added a lot of type defenitions to Uppy in [#834](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/834). So if you are using TypeScript (and even if not, your code editor / linting tool likely supports type defenitions), you are in for a treat!

## Other Cool Changes

- Fix: Debounce render calls again, fixes #669 (#796)
- Fix: XHRUPload canceled uploads progress events (#864) 
- Improvement: ⚠️ **breaking** Remove `uppy.run()` — everything is now run automatically, you only need to call `.use()` for plugins that you need, as usual (#793)
- Improvement: Dashboard open/close animation (#852)
- Improvement: You can now hide action buttons in Dashboard and StatusBar (#821)
- Improvement: Pass `allowedFileTypes` and `maxNumberOfFiles` to `input[type=file]` to add restrictions to the system file picking dialog too (#814)
- Improvement: merge meta data when add file (#810)
- Fix: More robust failure handling for Transloadit, closes #708 (#805)

In the next release we are planning a [Lerna conversion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/906), meaning that each Uppy plugin / module will get its own NPM package. Pretty excited about that one. 

See you in the next one!
