Hi! Another month has passed and we have just released a new version of Uppy. Here’s what we’ve been up to.

## Thinking about the future 🔮

We have been spending quite a lot of time thinking about Uppy's future and the direction in which we would like to take this project.  Our primary concern is making Uppy as flexible as possible as well as compatible with popular libraries, such as React and React Native.  We also want to make it easy to port Uppy to any environments or ecosystems that are not officially supported.

We have done a lot of research. We created [prototypes of Uppy React components](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react) and  we also created a new module that we like to call "Uppy Base." [`uppy-base`](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base) is a thin module containing reusable functionality from some of our plugins that can be used in any ecosystem or environment, without being opinionated about the UI.

Finally, we are also discussing using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) as the internal state management store within Uppy.  You can see some drafts under the [`src/experimental' folder](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/src/experimental).

Have a look at the [Uppy Base repository here](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base).

Check out [our Uppy React wrapper and components](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react), which are built on top of Uppy Base.

Finally, we have played a bit with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules) and [CSJS](https://github.com/rtsao/csjs).  We have also tried generating preview thumbnails in Web Workers, as well as with [Pica library](https://github.com/nodeca/pica).

We would love to hear feedback on all of this.  Please join our discussion at: https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/116

You are, of course, more than welcome to chime in on other issues or to open new ones!

## Dashboard: refreshed look and new features

In an attempt to be brave and keep things simple, we have removed the dashed border from inside the Dashboard, rewritten its layout with flexbox, and tried out a new [blend-in-with-the-background-and-blur](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1199054/18763191/35d31ddc-80da-11e6-9a2c-c46388857135.png) mode.

Uppy now also has the option to render the Dashboard inline on the page, instead of the default full modal dialog. To try it out, set `inline: true` in options, like this: `uppy.use(Dashboard, {target: '.myContainer', inline: true})`.

We have also added a circular progress bar that shows total upload progress, combined with a pause all / resume all button, and an info panel that shows speed, ETA and status for all uploads currently in progress. So you'll have something fun and useful to look at while you are waiting!

Be sure not to miss out on the new Copy Link button that appears after a successful upload, right where the edit button usually is. We know, that’s pretty exciting! And it gets even better: when you click on it, the link is copied to your clipboard. Or, in less capable browsers, a window pops up with a text link, so you can copy it yourself. Bananas!

## Google Drive UI improved

The UI for Google Drive has received a fresh new redesign.  Check it out!

## Listen to events

We have finally begun to expose events on the `uppy` instance, so you can now subscribe to them and use them in your app. For example, in order to display an image in your UI after it has been successfully uploaded:

``` javascript
uppy.on('core:upload-success', (id, url) => {
  var img = new Image()
  img.width = 300
  img.alt = id
  img.src = url
  document.body.appendChild(img)
})
```

There is also `core:upload-progress` to track progress and `core:success` for when all uploads are complete. The [event documentation](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#api) is quite small right now, we’ll be adding more once we sort out the API.

## But wait, there’s more!

* i18n strings now extend default en_US dictionary: if a certain string is not available in a language, the English string will be displayed.
* Updated readme: improved usage docs and CDN links. Check out [the new usage section](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#usage) for yourself. Import, require or script tag? In any case, we’ve got your back.
* Capabilities: we have added "capabilities" to the state.  For example, if 'tus' resumable uploader is used, `capabilities.resumable === true` is added to the state, so it is easy to check what upload capabilities are available. More to come.

## Release Notes

Here is the full list of changes for version 0.10.0:

- core: refactor towards react compatibility as discussed in https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/110 (@hedgerh)

- core: try Web Workers and FileReaderSync for image resizing again — still slow, probably message payload between webworker and regular thread is huge (@arturi)
