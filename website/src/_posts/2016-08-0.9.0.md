We have just released Uppy 0.9.0. This release features some changes that we think you will be very excited about.  Let's see what's new!

<!-- more -->

## Ability to pause uploads, progress indicators & ETA
The most visible feature that has been added is the ability to pause and resume file uploads.

The upload dashboard now contains more information about uploads, such as the time remaining until an upload is finished. We have also added circular progress indicators to give better visual feedback on an upload's progress.

## Remote file uploads
Remote file uploading is now working again.

## Informer interface
We have added a new `Informer` plugin (tested with `Dashboard`, should also work anywhere else) that listens to `informer` events, like so:
``` javascript
bus.emit('informer', message, type, duration)
```
 and displays a message bubble for a certain amount of time. It will be useful to notify you when the internet connection is (a licky boom-boom) down (or back up):

Or when Uppy has successfully uploaded your files:

## Webcam: Say Cheese!
The Webcam plugin can now take snapshots and add them to the file dashboard in Uppy's modal.  We have also added Flash support for Safari/IE users.  The UI has also been cleaned up in the dashboard.  We have temporarily disabled video recording in order to focus on rolling out the snapshot feature.

## Under the hood: UI refactors
Under the hood, we have made some changes to how the UI is structured.  We are taking a more componentized approach.  For example, the rendering of Google Drive's UI has been separated into multiple smaller components that can be found in the [`plugins/GoogleDrive` folder](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/src/plugins/GoogleDrive).
