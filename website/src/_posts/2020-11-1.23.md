Uppy 1.23 brings Vue.js components 💥, Box file service support, a “Done” button for the Status Bar + Dashboard, and a better cloud file restrictions UI.

## Vue.js

We’ve had [Uppy React components](https://uppy.io/docs/react/) available for quite some time now. With the increasing popularity of Vue.js library, we’re proud to announce it’s now much easier to use [Uppy with Vue](https://uppy.io/docs/vue/), thanks to the amazing work by [Andrew Kachnic](https://mobile.twitter.com/su_andrewk):

```sh
npm install @uppy/vue
```

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <dashboard :uppy="uppy" :plugins="['Webcam']"/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { Dashboard } from '@uppy/vue'

import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css'
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css'

import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    Dashboard
  },
  computed: {
    uppy: () => new Uppy().use(Webcam)
  },
  beforeDestroy () {
    this.uppy.close()
  }
}
</script>
```

`@uppy/vue` package provides components for all of the most popular Uppy UI plugins:

*   `<dashboard />` - renders an inline `@uppy/dashboard`
*   `<dashboard-modal />` - renders a `@uppy/dashboard` modal
*   `<drag-drop />` - renders a `@uppy/drag-drop` area
*   `<progress-bar />` - renders a `@uppy/progress-bar`
*   `<status-bar />` - renders a `@uppy/status-bar`

Check out the [Vue documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/vue/) for details.

Angular and Svelte support is on our list next.

## Cloud File Restrictions

Dropbox, Instagram, Google Drive and other cloud providers now immediately gray out files that won’t pass Uppy restrictions set by the developer:

## Done Button

If [`doneButtonHandler`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#doneButtonHandler) option is passed to the Status Bar plugin, it will render a “Done” button in place of Pause/Resume/Cancel buttons, once the upload/encoding is done. The behaviour of the “Done” button is defined by the handler function — can be used to close file picker modals or clear the upload state.

By default the Done button will close the Dashboard modal window and reset Uppy state.

## Box File Provider

Thanks to [@cartfisk](https://github.com/cartfisk) Uppy gains support for Box file service. You can add try it out by doing `npm install @uppy/box` and upgrading `@uppy/companion` to the latest version.

Bragging moment, here’s what [@cartfish had to say about Uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2549#issue-491527196):

> Hope this is useful! Hats off to the awesome React integration, easy contribution workflow, helpful docs, and readable, clean code. 10/10.

## Image Editor Optional Buttons

`@uppy/image-editor` plugin got support for optional buttons — you can choose to hide or show just the ones you need — crop, rotate, square, landscape, etc. Thanks, [@lamartire](https://github.com/lamartire)!

See new [`actions`](https://uppy.io/docs/image-editor/#Options) property in the Image Editor’s options.
