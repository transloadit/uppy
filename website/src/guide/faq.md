## Why does your site look like vuejs.org?

The website started as a clone of Yuxi Evan You's wonderful [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) website ([view license](website/VUEORG_LICENSE)) - just so we can hit the ground running in terms of Hexo boilerplate. As we go we'll be rolling out more original content and design and make this place our own. 

We have <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/672441843183960067">consent</a> of Yuxi Evan You for this. We're redistributing his <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/website/VUEORG_LICENSE">LICENSE</a>, and will keep credits in the footer in tact as long as this remains a direct descendant.
