Transloadit is providing Uppy free of charge. If you want, you can self-host all of its components and never pay us a dime. There are docs and tests, and your Bug Reports and Feature Requests are always welcome on GitHub.

There is also a different category of support that we like to call Integration Help: assistance to make things work for your environment, that have already been reported as working for the larger community.

As much as we at Transloadit would like to provide detailed Integration Help to every non-paying user, Uppy has reached a point where this is no longer sustainable for our small crew. If we end up investing our time in a million different apps that use Uppy, as long as there is no money flowing back, we won't be able to ramp up our team to meet the demand. This would spread the team ever thinner and eventually grind development to a halt.

That is not where we want to be. So, in order to offer enthusiasts, businesses, and enterprises assistance in a sustainable way, we're providing community-based Integration Help for free at <https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy>. If you are unable to solve your problem with help of the Uppy community, we offer paid Integration Help via <https://uppy.io/support>.
