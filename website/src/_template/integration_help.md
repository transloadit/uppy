Transloadit is providing Uppy free of charge. If you want, you can self-host all its components and never pay us a dime. You can access docs and tests, and your Bug Reports and Feature Requests are always welcome on GitHub.

We offer also a different category of support that we like to call Integration Help: help to make things work for your environment, that have already been reported as working for the larger community.

As much as we at Transloadit would like to provide detailed Integration Help to every non-paying user, Uppy has reached a point where this is no longer sustainable for our small crew. If we end up investing our time in a million different apps that use Uppy, as long as no money is flowing back, we won’t be able to ramp up our team to meet the demand. This would spread the team ever thinner and eventually grind development to a halt.

That is not where we want to be. So, to offer enthusiasts, businesses, and enterprises help in a sustainable way, we’re providing community-based Integration Help for free at <https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy>. If you are unable to solve your problem with help of the Uppy community, we offer paid Integration Help via <https://transloadit.com/open-source/support/>.
