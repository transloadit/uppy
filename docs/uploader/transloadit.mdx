# Transloadit

The `@uppy/transloadit` plugin can be used to upload files directly to
[Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) for all kinds of processing, such as
transcoding video, resizing images, zipping/unzipping, [and much
more][transloadit-services].

## When should I use it?

:::tip

Not sure which uploader is best for you? Read
“[Choosing the uploader you need](/docs/guides/choosing-uploader)”.

:::

Transloadit’s strength is versatility. By doing video, audio, images, documents,
and more, you only need one vendor for [all your file processing
needs][transloadit-services]. The `@uppy/transloadit` plugin directly uploads to
Transloadit so you only have to worry about creating a
[Template][transloadit-concepts]. Transloadit accepts the files, processes
according to the instructions in the Template, and stores the results in storage
of your choosing, such as a self-owned S3 bucket. The Transloadit plugin uses
[Tus](/docs/tus) under the hood so you don’t have to sacrifice reliable,
resumable uploads.

You should use `@uppy/transloadit` if you don’t want to host your own Tus or
Companion servers, (optionally) need file processing, and store it in the
service (such as S3 or GCS) of your liking. All with minimal effort.

## Use

A quick overview of the complete API.

```js {10-17} showLineNumbers
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Dashboard from '@uppy/dashboard';
import Transloadit from '@uppy/transloadit';

import '@uppy/core/dist/style.min.css';
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.min.css';

const uppy = new Uppy()
	.use(Dashboard, { inline: true, target: 'body' })
	.use(Transloadit, {
		assemblyOptions: {
			params: {
				auth: { key: 'your-transloadit-key' },
				template_id: 'your-template-id',
			},
		},
	});
// Optionally listen to events
uppy.on('transloadit:assembly-created', (assembly, fileIDs) => {});
uppy.on('transloadit:upload', (file, assembly) => {});
uppy.on('transloadit:assembly-executing', (assembly) => {});
uppy.on('transloadit:result', (stepName, result, assembly) => {});
uppy.on('transloadit:complete', (assembly) => {});
```

### Use with Companion

:::note

All [Transloadit plans](https://transloadit.com/pricing/) come with a hosted
version of Companion.

:::

You can use this plugin together with Transloadit’s hosted Companion service to
let your users import files from third party sources across the web. To do so
each provider plugin must be configured with Transloadit’s Companion URLs:

```js
import { COMPANION_URL, COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS } from '@uppy/transloadit';
import Dropbox from '@uppy/dropbox';

uppy.use(Dropbox, {
	companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
	companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
});
```

This will already work. Transloadit’s OAuth applications are used to
authenticate your users by default. Your users will be asked to provide
Transloadit access to their files. Since your users are probably not aware of
Transloadit, this may be confusing or decrease trust. You may also hit rate
limits, because the OAuth application is shared between everyone using
Transloadit.

To solve that, you can use your own OAuth keys with Transloadit’s hosted
Companion servers by using Transloadit Template Credentials. [Create a Template
Credential][template-credentials] on the Transloadit site. Select “Companion
OAuth” for the service, and enter the key and secret for the provider you want
to use. Then you can pass the name of the new credentials to that provider:

```js
import { COMPANION_URL, COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS } from '@uppy/transloadit';
import Dropbox from '@uppy/dropbox';

uppy.use(Dropbox, {
	companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
	companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	companionKeysParams: {
		key: 'YOUR_TRANSLOADIT_API_KEY',
		credentialsName: 'my_companion_dropbox_creds',
	},
});
```

## API

### Options

#### `id`

A unique identifier for this plugin (`string`, default: `'Transloadit'`).

#### `service`

The Transloadit API URL to use (`string`, default:
`https://api2.transloadit.com`).

The default will try to route traffic efficiently based on the location of your
users. You could for instance set it to `https://api2-us-east-1.transloadit.com`
if you need the traffic to stay inside a particular region.

#### `limit`

Limit the amount of uploads going on at the same time (`number`, default: `20`).

Setting this to `0` means no limit on concurrent uploads, but we recommend a
value between `5` and `20`. This option is passed through to the
[`@uppy/tus`](/docs/tus) plugin, which this plugin uses internally.

#### `assemblyOptions`

Configure the
[Assembly Instructions](https://transloadit.com/docs/topics/assembly-instructions/),
the fields to send along to the assembly, and authentication
(`object | function`, default: `null`).

The object you can pass or return from a function has this structure:

```js
{
  params: {
    auth: { key: 'key-from-transloadit' },
    template_id: 'id-from-transloadit',
    steps: {
      // Overruling Template at runtime
    },
    notify_url: 'https://your-domain.com/assembly-status',
  },
  signature: 'generated-signature',
  fields: {
    // Dynamic or static fields to send along
  },
}
```

- `params` is used to authenticate with Transloadit and using your desired
  [template](https://transloadit.com/docs/topics/templates/).
  - `auth.key` _(required)_ is your authentication key which you can find on the
    “Credentials” page of your account.
  - `template_id` _(required)_ is the unique identifier to use the right
    template from your account.
  - `steps` _(optional)_ can be used to
    [overrule Templates at runtime](https://transloadit.com/docs/topics/templates/#overruling-templates-at-runtime).
    A typical use case might be changing the storage path on the fly based on
    the session user id. For most use cases, we recommend to let your Templates
    handle dynamic cases (they can accept `fields` and execute arbitrary
    JavaScript as well), and not pass in `steps` from a browser. The template
    editor also has extra validations and context.
  - `notify_url` _(optional)_ is a pingback with the assembly status as JSON.
    For instance, if you don’t want to block the user experience by letting them
    wait for your template to complete with
    [`waitForEncoding`](#waitForEncoding), but you do want to want to
    asynchrounously have an update, you can provide an URL which will be
    “pinged” with the assembly status.
- `signature` _(optional, but recommended)_ is a cryptographic signature to
  provide further trust in unstrusted environments. Refer to
  “[Signature Authentication”](https://transloadit.com/docs/topics/signature-authentication/)
  for more information.
- `fields` _(optional)_ can be used to to send along key/value pairs, which can
  be
  [used dynamically in your template](https://transloadit.com/docs/topics/assembly-instructions/#form-fields-in-instructions).

:::info

All your files end up in a single assembly and your `fields` are available
globally in your template. The metadata in your Uppy files is also sent along so
you can do things dynamically per file with `file.user_meta` in your template.

:::

<details>
  <summary>Examples</summary>

**As a function**

Most likely you want to use a function to call your backend to generate a
signature and return your configuration.

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	async assemblyOptions() {
		const res = await fetch('/transloadit-params');
		return res.json();
	},
});
```

**As an object**

If you don’t need to change anything dynamically, you can also pass an object
directly.

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	assemblyOptions: {
		params: { auth: { key: 'transloadit-key' } },
	},
});
```

**Use with @uppy/form**

Combine the `assemblyOptions()` option with the [Form](/docs/form) plugin to
pass user input from a `<form>` to a Transloadit Assembly:

```js
// This will add form field values to each file's `.meta` object:
uppy.use(Form, { getMetaFromForm: true });
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	async assemblyOptions() {
    const res = await fetch('/transloadit-params');
		return res.json();
  };
});
```

</details>

:::caution

When you go to production always make sure to set the `signature`. **Not using
[Signature Authentication](https://transloadit.com/docs/topics/signature-authentication/)
can be a security risk**. Signature Authentication is a security measure that
can prevent outsiders from tampering with your Assembly Instructions. While
Signature Authentication is not implemented (yet), we recommend to disable
`allow_steps_override` in your Templates to avoid outsiders being able to pass
in any Instructions and storage targets on your behalf.

:::

#### `waitForEncoding`

Wait for the template to finish, rather than only the upload, before marking the
upload complete (`boolean`, default: `false`).

- When `false`, the Assemblies will complete (or error) in the background but
  Uppy won’t know or care about it. You may have to let Transloadit ping you via
  a `notify_url` and asynchronously inform your user (email, in-app
  notification).
- When `true`, the Transloadit plugin waits for Assemblies to complete before
  the files are marked as completed. This means users have to wait for a
  potentially long time, depending on how complicated your Assembly instructions
  are. But, you can receive the final status and transcoding results on the
  client side with less effort.

When this is enabled, you can listen for the
[`transloadit:result`](#transloaditresult) and
[`transloadit:complete`](#transloaditcomplete) events.

#### `waitForMetadata`

Wait for Transloadit’s backend to catch early errors, not the entire Assembly to
complete. (`boolean`, default: `false`)

When set to `true`, the Transloadit plugin waits for Transloadit’s backend to
extract metadata from all the uploaded files. This is mostly handy if you want
to have a quick user experience (so your users don’t necessarily need to wait
for all the encoding to complete), but you do want to let users know about some
types of errors that can be caught early on, like file format issues.

You you can listen for the [`transloadit:upload`](#transloaditupload) event when
this or `waitForEncoding` is enabled.

#### `importFromUploadURLs`

Allow another plugin to upload files, and then import those files into the
Transloadit Assembly (`boolean`, default: `false`).

When enabling this option, Transloadit will _not_ configure the Tus plugin to
upload to Transloadit. Instead, a separate upload plugin must be used. Once the
upload completes, the Transloadit plugin adds the uploaded file to the Assembly.

For example, to upload files to an S3 bucket and then transcode them:

```js
uppy.use(AwsS3, {
	getUploadParameters(file) {
		return {
			/* upload parameters */
		};
	},
});
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	importFromUploadURLs: true,
	assemblyOptions: {
		params: {
			auth: { key: 'YOUR_API_KEY' },
			template_id: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',
		},
	},
});
```

Tranloadit will download the files and expose them to your Template as
`:original`, as if they were directly uploaded from the Uppy client.

:::note

For this to work, the upload plugin must assign a publicly accessible
`uploadURL` property to the uploaded file object. The Tus and S3 plugins both do
this automatically, but you must configure your S3 bucket to have publicly
readable objects. For the XHRUpload plugin, you may have to specify a custom
`getResponseData` function.

:::

#### `alwaysRunAssembly`

Always create and run an Assembly when `uppy.upload()` is called, even if no
files were selected (`boolean`, default: `false`).

This allows running Assemblies that do not receive files, but instead use a
robot like [`/s3/import`](https://transloadit.com/docs/transcoding/#s3-import)
to download the files from elsewhere, for example, for a bulk transcoding job.

#### `locale`

```js
export default {
	strings: {
		// Shown while Assemblies are being created for an upload.
		creatingAssembly: 'Preparing upload...',
		// Shown if an Assembly could not be created.
		creatingAssemblyFailed: 'Transloadit: Could not create Assembly',
		// Shown after uploads have succeeded, but when the Assembly is still executing.
		// This only shows if `waitForMetadata` or `waitForEncoding` was enabled.
		encoding: 'Encoding...',
	},
};
```

#### `clientName`

Append a custom client name to the `Transloadit-Client` header field when
creating an Assembly (`string`, default: `null`).

The `Transloadit-Client` header includes by default information about the used
SDK and is included in the Assembly Status under the `transloadit_client`
property. By providing a value, such as `homepage-file-uploader`, you can
identify the client and SDK that created a given Assembly.

<details>
  <summary>Deprecated options</summary>

These options have been deprecated in favor of
[`assemblyOptions`](#assemblyoptions), which we now recommend for all use cases.
You can still use these options, but they will be removed in the next major
version.

#### `getAssemblyOptions`

This function behaves the same as passing a function to
[`assemblyOptions`](#assemblyoptions).

#### `params`

The Assembly parameters to use for the upload (`object`, default: `null`) See
the Transloadit documentation on
[Assembly Instructions](https://transloadit.com/docs/#14-assembly-instructions)
for further information.

The `auth.key` Assembly parameter is required. You can also use the `steps` or
`template_id` options here as described in the Transloadit documentation.

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	params: {
		auth: { key: 'YOUR_TRANSLOADIT_KEY' },
		steps: {
			encode: {
				robot: '/video/encode',
				use: {
					steps: [':original'],
					fields: ['file_input_field2'],
				},
				preset: 'iphone',
			},
		},
	},
});
```

#### `signature`

An optional signature for the Assembly parameters. See the Transloadit
documentation on
[Signature Authentication](https://transloadit.com/docs/#26-signature-authentication)
for further information.

If a `signature` is provided, `params` should be a JSON string instead of a
JavaScript object, as otherwise the generated JSON in the browser may be
different from the JSON string that was used to generate the signature.

#### `fields`

An object of form fields to send along to the Assembly. Keys are field names,
and values are field values. See also the Transloadit documentation on
[Form Fields In Instructions](https://transloadit.com/docs/#23-form-fields-in-instructions).

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	// ...
	fields: {
		message: 'This is a form field',
	},
});
```

You can also pass an array of field names to send global or file metadata along
to the Assembly. Global metadata is set using the
[`meta` option](/docs/uppy/#meta) in the Uppy constructor, or using the
[`setMeta` method](/docs/uppy/#uppy-setMeta-data). File metadata is set using
the [`setFileMeta`](/docs/uppy/#uppy-setFileMeta-fileID-data) method. The
[Form](/docs/form) plugin also sets global metadata based on the values of
`<input />`s in the form, providing a handy way to use values from HTML form
fields:

```js
uppy.use(Form, { target: 'form#upload-form', getMetaFromForm: true });
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	fields: ['field_name', 'other_field_name'],
	params: {
		/* ... */
	},
});
```

Form fields can also be computed dynamically using custom logic, by using the
[`getAssemblyOptions(file)`](/docs/transloadit/#getAssemblyOptions-file) option.

</details>

### Static exports

#### `COMPANION_URL`

The main endpoint for Transloadit’s hosted companions. You can use this constant
in remote provider options, like so:

```js
import Dropbox from '@uppy/dropbox';
import { COMPANION_URL } from '@uppy/transloadit';

uppy.use(Dropbox, {
	companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
});
```

When using `COMPANION_URL`, you should also configure
[`companionAllowedHosts`](#companion_allowed_hosts).

The value of this constant is `https://api2.transloadit.com/companion`. If you
are using a custom [`service`](#service) option, you should also set a custom
host option in your provider plugins, by taking a Transloadit API url and
appending `/companion`:

```js
uppy.use(Dropbox, {
	companionUrl: 'https://api2-us-east-1.transloadit.com/companion',
});
```

#### `COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS`

A RegExp pattern matching Transloadit’s hosted companion endpoints. The pattern
is used in remote provider `companionAllowedHosts` options, to make sure that
third party authentication messages cannot be faked by an attacker’s page but
can only originate from Transloadit’s servers.

Use it whenever you use `companionUrl: COMPANION_URL`, like so:

```js
import Dropbox from '@uppy/dropbox';
import { COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS } from '@uppy/transloadit';

uppy.use(Dropbox, {
	companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
});
```

The value of this constant covers _all_ Transloadit’s Companion servers, so it
does not need to be changed if you are using a custom [`service`](#service)
option. But, if you are not using the Transloadit Companion servers at
`*.transloadit.com`, make sure to set the `companionAllowedHosts` option to
something that matches what you do use.

### Events

#### `transloadit:assembly-created`

Fired when an Assembly is created.

**Parameters**

- `assembly` - The initial [Assembly Status][assembly-status].
- `fileIDs` - The IDs of the files that will be uploaded to this Assembly.

```js
uppy.on('transloadit:assembly-created', (assembly, fileIDs) => {
	console.group('Created', assembly.assembly_id, 'for files:');
	for (const id of fileIDs) {
		console.log(uppy.getFile(id).name);
	}
	console.groupEnd();
});
```

#### `transloadit:upload`

Fired when Transloadit has received an upload. Requires
[`waitForMetadata`](#waitformetadata) to be set.

**Parameters**

- `file` - The Transloadit file object that was uploaded.
- `assembly` - The [Assembly Status][assembly-status] of the Assembly to which
  the file was uploaded.

#### `transloadit:assembly-executing`

Fired when Transloadit has received all uploads, and is executing the Assembly.

**Parameters**

- `assembly` - The
  [Assembly Status](https://transloadit.com/docs/api/#assembly-status-response)
  of the Assembly that is executing.

#### `transloadit:result`

Fired when a result came in from an Assembly. Requires
[`waitForEncoding`](#waitforencoding) to be set.

**Parameters**

- `stepName` - The name of the Assembly step that generated this result.
- `result` - The result object from Transloadit. This result object has one more
  property, namely `localId`. This is the ID of the file in Uppy’s local state,
  and can be used with `uppy.getFile(id)`.
- `assembly` - The [Assembly Status][assembly-status] of the Assembly that
  generated this result.

```js
uppy.on('transloadit:result', (stepName, result) => {
	const file = uppy.getFile(result.localId);
	document.body.appendChild(html`
		<div>
			<h2>From ${file.name}</h2>
			<a href=${result.ssl_url}> View </a>
		</div>
	`);
});
```

#### `transloadit:complete`

Fired when an Assembly completed. Requires [`waitForEncoding`](#waitForEncoding)
to be set.

**Parameters**

- `assembly` - The final [Assembly Status][assembly-status] of the completed
  Assembly.

```js
uppy.on('transloadit:complete', (assembly) => {
	// Could do something fun with this!
	console.log(assembly.results);
});
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Accessing the assembly when an error occurred

If an error occurs when an Assembly has already started, you can find the
Assembly Status on the error object’s `assembly` property.

```js
uppy.on('error', (error) => {
	if (error.assembly) {
		console.log(`Assembly ID ${error.assembly.assembly_id} failed!`);
		console.log(error.assembly);
	}
});
```

### Assembly behavior when Uppy is closed

When integrating `@uppy/transloadit` with `@uppy/dashboard`, closing the
dashboard will result in continuing assemblies on the server. When the user
manually cancels the upload any running assemblies will be cancelled.
