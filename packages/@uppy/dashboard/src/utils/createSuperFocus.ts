  //    1. To deal with animations: overlay changes via animations, which results in the DOM updating AFTER plugin.update()
  //       already executed.
  //    [Practical check] without debounce, if we open the Url overlay, and click 'Done', Dashboard won't get focused again.
  //    [Practical check] if we delay 250ms instead of 260ms - IE11 won't get focused in same situation.
  //    2. Performance: there can be many state update()s in a second, and this function is called every time.
