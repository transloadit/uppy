The Google Drive plugin for Uppy lets users import files from their Google Drive
account.

A Companion instance is required for the GoogleDrive plugin to work. Companion
handles authentication with Google, downloads files from the Drive and uploads
them to the destination. This saves the user bandwidth, especially helpful if
they are on a mobile connection.

Uppy is being developed by the folks at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com),
a versatile file encoding service.

## Example

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import GoogleDrive from '@uppy/google-drive'

const uppy = new Uppy()
uppy.use(GoogleDrive, {
  // Options
})
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @uppy/google-drive
```

Alternatively, you can also use this plugin in a pre-built bundle from
Transloaditâ€™s CDN: Smart CDN. In that case `Uppy` will attach itself to the
global `window.Uppy` object. See the
[main Uppy documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/#Installation) for instructions.
