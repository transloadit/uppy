The Unsplash plugin lets users import files from Unsplash, the free stock
photography resource.

A Companion instance is required for the Unsplash plugin to work. Companion will
download the files and upload them to their destination. This saves bandwidth
for the user (especially on mobile connections) and helps avoid CORS
restrictions.

Uppy is being developed by the folks at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com),
a versatile file encoding service.

## Example

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Unsplash from '@uppy/unsplash'

const uppy = new Uppy()
uppy.use(Unsplash, {
  // Options
})
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @uppy/unsplash --save
```

Alternatively, you can also use this plugin in a pre-built bundle from
Transloaditâ€™s CDN: Smart CDN. In that case `Uppy` will attach itself to the
global `window.Uppy` object. See the
[main Uppy documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/#Installation) for instructions.
