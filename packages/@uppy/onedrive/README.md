The OneDrive plugin for Uppy lets users import files from their OneDrive
account.

A Companion instance is required for the OneDrive plugin to work. Companion
handles authentication with Microsoft OneDrive, downloads files from OneDrive
and uploads them to the destination. This saves the user bandwidth, especially
helpful if they are on a mobile connection.

Uppy is being developed by the folks at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com),
a versatile file encoding service.

## Example

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Facebook from '@uppy/onedrive'

const uppy = new Uppy()
uppy.use(OneDrive, {
  // Options
})
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @uppy/onedrive
```

Alternatively, you can also use this plugin in a pre-built bundle from
Transloaditâ€™s CDN: Smart CDN. In that case `Uppy` will attach itself to the
global `window.Uppy` object. See the
[main Uppy documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/#Installation) for instructions.
