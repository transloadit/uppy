## Reporting a Vulnerability

How to Report a Vulnerability

    Contact Us: Please send your report via email to [peter@jensen.wtf]. This will ensure that it reaches the right us quickly.

    Provide Details: Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, such as the steps to reproduce it, its potential impact, and any suggestions you have for a fix.

Our Response Process

Upon receiving your report, here's what you can expect from us:

    Acknowledgement: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report ASAP (hopefully within 48 hours)

    Communication: We'll keep you updated on our progress. Expect an update at least every 72 hours until the issue is resolved.

    Confidentiality: We ask that you keep the issue confidential until we've had a chance to address it. We'll coordinate with you on public disclosure.

    Resolution: We'll work diligently to resolve the issue. If your report is accepted, we'll notify you of the resolution and any steps we're taking to prevent similar issues in the future.

    Recognition: Contributors who responsibly report vulnerabilities will be acknowledged (if desired) in our public communications about the issue.

Policy on Accepted and Declined Reports

    Accepted Reports: If we confirm the vulnerability and its impact, we'll work with you to validate and address it.

    Declined Reports: If we determine that the report doesn't represent a real vulnerability, or it's not applicable to our project, we'll let you know why.

Thank you for helping us keep our software secure.
