The XHRUpload plugin handles classic XHR uploads with Uppy. If you have an
exiting Apache/Nginx/Node or whatever backend, this is probably the Uppy
uploader plugin you are looking for.

Uppy is being developed by the folks at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com),
a versatile file encoding service.

## Example

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import XHRUpload from '@uppy/xhr-upload'

const uppy = new Uppy()
uppy.use(XHRUpload, {
  // Options
})
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @uppy/xhr-upload
```

Alternatively, you can also use this plugin in a pre-built bundle from
Transloaditâ€™s CDN: Smart CDN. In that case `Uppy` will attach itself to the
global `window.Uppy` object. See the
[main Uppy documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/#Installation) for instructions.

## Documentation

Documentation for this plugin can be found on the
