# Redux

This example uses Uppy with a Redux store.
The same Redux store is also used for other parts of the application, namely the counter example.
Each action is logged to the console using [redux-logger](https://github.com/theaqua/redux-logger).

This example supports the [Redux Devtools extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), including time travel.

## Run it

Move into this directory, then:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
