# Redux

This example uses Uppy with a Redux store.
The same Redux store is also used for other parts of the application, namely the counter example.
Each action is logged to the console using [redux-logger](https://github.com/theaqua/redux-logger).

This example supports the [Redux Devtools extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), including time travel.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:
```bash
npm install
```
That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:
```bash
npm run example redux
```
