# Uppy + PHP Example

This example uses PHP server and `@uppy/xhr-upload` to upload files to the local
file system.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository
root**:

```sh
corepack yarn install
corepack yarn build
```

That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:

```sh
corepack yarn workspace @uppy-example/php-xhr start
```
