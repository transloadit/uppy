# Uppy + Node Example

This example uses Node server and `@uppy/xhr-upload` to upload files to the
local file system.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository
root**:

```sh
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm build
```

That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:

```sh
corepack pnpm --filter @uppy-example/node-xhr start
```
