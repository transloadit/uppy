# Uppy + Node Example

This example uses Node server and `@uppy/xhr-upload` to upload files to the local file system.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:
```bash
npm install
```
That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:
```bash
npm run example node-xhr
```
