# Uppy in React Native Expo (Beta)

⚠️ In Beta

`@uppy/react-native` is a basic Uppy component for React Native with Expo. It is in Beta, and is not full-featured. You can select local images or videos, take a picture with a camera or add any file from a remote url with Uppy Companion.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository root**:
```bash
npm install
```
That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, again in the **repository root**, start this example by doing:
```bash
npm run example react-native-expo
```

Then a tab will open in your browser with Expo UI, and you can choose to run the example in either an iOS or Android simulator, or right on your mobile device with an Expo app — might be easier, if you don’t want to install emulators.
