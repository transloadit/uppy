# Uppy in React Native Expo (Beta)

⚠️ In Beta

`@uppy/react-native` is a basic Uppy component for React Native with Expo. It is
in Beta, and is not full-featured. You can select local images or videos, take a
picture with a camera or add any file from a remote url with Uppy Companion.

## Run it

To run this example, make sure you've correctly installed the **repository
root**:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
```

That will also install the dependencies for this example.

Then, start this example by doing:

```bash
cd examples/react-native-expo
yarn start
```

Then you'll see a menu within your terminal where you can chose where to open
the app (Android, iOS, device etc.)
