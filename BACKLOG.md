# Backlog

<!--lint disable no-literal-urls no-undefined-references-->

These are ideas that are planned for specific versions or act as a backlog
without a clear date. PRs are welcome! Please do open an issue to discuss first
if it's a big feature, priorities may have changed after something was added
here.

## `3.0.0`

- [x] Switch to ES Modules (ESM)
- [x] @uppy/image-editor: Remove silly hack to work around non-ESM.
- [ ] Some not too breaking breaking changes. Go through TODOs (@arturi,
      @aduh95, @Murderlon)
- [ ] Companion breaking changes, like S3 keys (@mifi)
- [x] New remote-sources preset
- [x] Deprecate Robodog
  - [x] Remove from 3.x branch (@aduh95)
  - [x] Update docs that refer to Robodog (@arturi)
  - [ ] Update Transloadit.com examples and docs to use @uppy/transloadit +
        @uppy/remote-sources plugins instead of @uppy/robodog (@arturi)

## `4.0.0`

- [ ] core: change the preprocessing --> uploading flow to allow for files to
      start uploading right away after their preprocessing step has finished.
      See #1738 (@goto-but-stop)
- [ ] companion: add more reliable tests to catch edge cases in companion. For
      example testing that oauth works for multiple companion instances that use
      a master Oauth domain.
- [ ] Consider updating the name of @uppy/aws-s3 and @uppy/aws-s3-multipart to
      reflect it also supports Google Cloud Storage, Wasabi, and other cloud
      providers.
- [ ] Consider fixing all locale files to follow the bcp-47 standard (nl_NL -->
      nl-NL)

## Unplanned

### Core

- [ ] Make sure Uppy works well in VR
- [ ] normalize file names when uploading from iOS? Can we do it with meta data?
      date? `image-${index}`? #678
- [ ] Can Uppy upload a lot of files at once? Seems to fail now:
      https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/3313 (@aduh95, @Murderlon)
- [ ] Consider how we can make Uppy smaller. Replace some packages with smaller
      alternatives. Talk about Socket.io again (@aduh95)
- [ ] Better events — more data, consistency, naming (@Murderlon)

### Dashboard

- [ ] Dashboard UI should support 20 providers (@arturi)
- [ ] Allow minimizing the Dashboard during upload (Uppy then becomes just a
      tiny progress indicator) (@arturi)
- [ ] Display data like image resolution on file cards. should be done by
      thumbnail generator maybe #783
- [ ] Possibility to edit/delete more than one file at once. example: add
      copyrigh info to 1000 files #118, #97
- [ ] Possibility to work on already uploaded / in progress files. We'll just
      provide the `fileId` to the `file-edit-complete` event so that folks can
      more easily roll out custom code for this themselves #112, #113, #2063
- [ ] Focus jumps weirdly if you remove a file
      https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2161#issuecomment-613565486
- [ ] A mini UI that features drop & progress (may involve a `mini: true`
      options for dashboard, may involve drop+progress or new plugin) (@arturi)
- [ ] Add a Load More button so you don't have to TAB endlessly to get to the
      upload button (https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1419)

### New plugins

- [ ] WordPress Back-end plugin. Should be another Transloadit Integration based
      on Robodog Dashboard(?) we should add a provider, and possibly offer
      already-uploaded content
- [ ] WordPress Front-end Gravity Forms Uppy plugin so one form field could be
      an Uppy-powered file input
- [ ] A WakeLock based plugin that keeps your phone from going to sleep while an
      upload is ongoing https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1725
- [ ] Improve image editor: filters for images, no crashes (@aduh95)

### New providers

- [ ] MediaLibrary provider which shows you files that have already been
      uploaded #450, #1121, #1112 #362
- [ ] Giphy image search (on top of Unsplash plugin) ()
- [ ] Image search (via Google or Bing or DuckDuckGo): use duckduckgo-images-api
      or Google Search API (@arturi)
- [ ] Vimeo #2872

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] goldenretriever: make it work with aws multipart
      https://community.transloadit.com/t/resumable-aws-s3-multipart-integration/14888
      (@goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] provider: add sorting (by date) #254
- [ ] qa: add one integration test (or add to existing test) that uses more
      exotic (tus) options such as `useFastRemoteRetry` or
      `removeFingerprintOnSuccess`
      https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1327 (@arturi,
      @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [x] react: Add a React Hook to manage an Uppy instance
      https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1247#issuecomment-458063951
      (@goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] rn: Uppy React Native works with Expo, now let's make it work without
- [ ] rn: Uppy React Native works with Url Plugin, now let's make it work with
      Instagram
- [ ] security: consider iframe / more security for Transloadit/Uppy integration
      widget and Uppy itself. Page can’t get files from Google Drive if its an
      iframe
- [ ] statusbar: Add a confirmation of the cancel action
      (https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1418) as well as ask the user
      if they really want to navigate away while an upload is in progress via
      `onbeforeunload` (@arturi)
- [ ] uploaders: consider not showing progress updates from the server after an
      upload’s been paused. Perhaps the button can be disabled and say
      `Pausing..` until Companion has actually stopped transmitting updates
      (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] xhr: allow sending custom headers per file (as proposed in #785)
- [ ] website: It would be nice in the long run to have a dynamic package
      builder here right on the website where you can select the plugins you
      need/want and it builds and downloads a minified version of them? Sort of
      like jQuery UI: https://jqueryui.com/download/
- [ ] webcam: Specify the resolution of the webcam images/video. We should add a
      way to specify any custom 'constraints' (aspect ratio, resolution,
      mimetype (`/video/mp4;codec=h264`), bits per second, etc) to the Webcam
      plugin #876
- [ ] Constructor to build Uppy with what you need, “Dashboard example meets
      Transloadit Wizard”. Select language, modes, providers — get code ready to
      use. Maybe integrate Transloadit Wizard in there as well (@arturi,
      @Murderlon)

### Needs research

- [ ] Add a prepublish test that checks if `npm pack` is not massive
      (@goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] Add https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y for automated accessibility testing?
- [ ] Add lighthouse for automated performance testing?
- [ ] Switch one existing e2e test to use Parcel (create-react-app already using
      webpack) (@arturi)
- [ ] Add typescript with JSDoc for @uppy/core
      https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files
      (@arturi)
